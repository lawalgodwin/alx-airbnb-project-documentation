# Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

As the name implies, this shows how data is exchanged within the system on an abstract level.

In this diagram, we describe the data flow only at the **context** and **level 0** abstract level.

We can go from level 1, 2, 3...

The more the level, the more detailed is the diagram as subsequent levels are emphasises on the previous processes.
