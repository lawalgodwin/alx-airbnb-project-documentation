# A high level overview of the Rental system

### What is a Use Case Diagram

A Use Case Diagram is a UML(Unified Modeling Diagram) used by professional software engineers to communicate how a system(Application) functions on a high level.
The basic components of a Use Case Diagram are:
1. The system and its functionalities
2. Actors - An actor could be human user or external system that interacts with our system
3. Relationship - This shows how the actors relate to the functionalities

The Use Case Diagram uses some UML Symbols to represent these components:
- ellipse: An elipse denotes a functionality/feature (e.g User Registration)
- Rectangle: A rectangle big enough to contain all the functionalities/features represents the system.
- A Rectangle or stick figure: This represents our system's Actor
- Solid/Dotted Arrow Line: Denotes the relationship existing between actors and functionalities

Here, we are illustrating a high level overview of the Rental system based on the core features and functionalities using a Use Case Diagram
